# Practice Class 1


## Basic Types and Operations

### 1. Int, long

int and long are both types for representing integers(positive or negative)

Mathematically, integer set is closed under + - * but not /. (/: 向零取整)

In Java, when there is decimals, down cast to the closed integer.

**Assignments: =**

### 2. Float/double

float and double are Java representations of *real* numbers.

### 3. char and characters in your program

Represents a CHARacter (English letter, or digits, or punctuation)

Single quote is char; Double quote is string. 

### 4. boolean

Boolean has two values, **true** and **false**.

Note: no quote for true and false - they are not strings.

### 5. Assignments vs. equals

Assignments: =

Equals: ==

### 6.  Type Conversion

implicit conversion: no (double) or (int)

Explicit conversion: with (double) or (int)

byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
